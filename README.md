# About Me 🚀  

I'm a **game developer** and **security enthusiast**, passionate about exploring modern technologies from a **security perspective** and crafting immersive worlds as my **artistic expression**.  

I have a deep love for **C++**, constantly reinventing the wheel to understand how things truly work under the hood. Outside of coding, you’ll find me **playing guitar, kickboxing, or practicing Wing Tsun**.

# Open-Source ❤️  

While much of my work has been in **freelance and private repositories**, I’m a strong advocate for **open-source development**. I’m actively shifting my workflow to contribute more to the **community**, sharing knowledge and building powerful tools.
